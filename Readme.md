# Java Array Operations

This project contains a simple Java program that performs array operations such as:
- Finding the smallest difference between consecutive elements.
- Categorizing numbers into odd and even numbers.
- Displaying the contents of an array.

## Files
- `Main.java`: Contains the main method and initiates the operations.
- `ArrayFunctions.java`: Contains the methods for array operations like odd-even categorization and finding the minimum difference.
- `UserInput.java`: Handles user input for array values.

## How to run
1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the `Main` class to interact with the program.
